# Enigma - software for astrological research

Enigma is software for astrological calculations. It is aimed at research into astrology. The program is build in Java 14 and JavaFX. I started this project in the last days of 2019. 

- You can download the installable application from : http://radixpro.com/enigma . You do not need to install JDK 14 as the installation is prepared with jPackage. 
- A User Manual is also available at  http://radixpro.com/enigma.
- A Programmers manual is available at : http://radixpro.org/documentation/Progman_2020_1.pdf.
- And the source is available at GitHub:  https://github.com/jankampherbeek/enigma.

If you want to build the program you will need an additional library and data files. Check the Programmers Manual for details.
